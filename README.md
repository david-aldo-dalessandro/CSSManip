## Intro

This is an application where you are able to generate HTML elements within a document as their own entities or as child entities of other elements you've created.

From their inception, you have the ability to customize the CSS properties to see how to either achieve a specific layout or experiment with options.

Initially this was created for me to explore and prototype CSS combinations of nested elements. Now it is used to see just how far I can make this little builder app.

## How to

### Run the app

Open the html file in your browser, or run it on a live server
